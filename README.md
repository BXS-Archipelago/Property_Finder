# The Property Finder Website

##  A website to produce a list of Advertisements from a database stored on MongoDB

### By : Brian Smyth



# About The Site :

With owners and selling-agents of Luxury Homes as our clients, the website is designed to attract both sellers and buyers so they can connect easily with each other.

---

## Strategic Points: 

- The target audience for the website will be : 
    
    - Age 21 to 75
    - Professional Adults
    - Investors in Property
    - Individuals or Couples seeking a new luxury Home
    - Individuals or Couples seeking a second luxury Home
    - Individuals or Couples selling their Property
    - Estate Agents or Sales Agents with Property interests
    - People interested in the property market as a hobby
    
The visitor from the Buyer sector can easily view the listing from the front page of the site with the option to search for particular interests. The visitor who is from the Selling sector can register to create their account. Once logged in, they can create new Advertisements easily.  

If the seller is the Owner of the property, they can identify themselves as such using a toggle-button. Otherwise, they will labelled as a selling agent. 
The ads can be edited if the user wishes to change any pertinent information, or they can even change the category of "For Sale" to "Sold", but retain the ad as active on the site. Finally, they have the option to delete the ad as they deem necessary as the account-holder.

### Noteworthy:

- This is a Business-To-Client website in the interest of generating revenue for the site owner. Those placing the ads will pay a subscription fee to use the service annually without restrictions on the number of ads. 

- For those property owners who wish to sell without agents, the advertising process is made simple but with a reduced subscription rate for once-off ads. 

- The site will act as a catalogue for buyers to peruse, but they will need to make contact with the sellers directly but externally. Sellers will provide information on how they wish to be contacted within their ad. 

- The website has an easy flow for either sellers or buyers. 

---

## Goals of the Site Owner: 

- There must be revenue. The selling process must be easy for any parties selling their property. The Subscription price will reflect the ease and speed of advertising campaigns. 
- Search Engines must easily find the site in buyer Searches of any common engines. 
- The required information must be immediate and of value to anybody visiting the site for the first time. 
- The properties listed will be luxury homes, so the site will not focus on high-volume of low-value properties. It will be available for boutique-property owners and investors. 
- The site owners will further advertise the site in search engines and relevant marketing platforms. 


## First-Time User Experiences: 
- As a first time visitor, I want to easily and efficiently navigate the site.
- I want to filter lists to find what I specifically want.
- I want to see photographs easily without cluttering my screen.
- I want to view the site on either small or large screen sizes. 

## Repeat Visitors Experiences:
- As a regular user, I need to log in quickly to my account.
- I want to see all current ads that I am running on the website. 
- I want to edit any spelling or grammar mistakes, or misinformation.
- I want to change the status of the property from "For Sale" to "Sold" easily.
